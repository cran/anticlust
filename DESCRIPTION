Description: The method of anticlustering partitions a pool of elements
    into groups (i.e., anticlusters) with the goal of maximizing
    between-group similarity or within-group heterogeneity.  The
    anticlustering approach thereby reverses the logic of cluster analysis
    that strives for high within-group homogeneity and low similarity of
    the different groups. Computationally, anticlustering is accomplished
    by maximizing instead of minimizing a clustering objective function,
    such as the intra-cluster variance (used in k-means clustering) or the
    sum of pairwise distances within clusters.  The function
    anticlustering() implements exact and heuristic anticlustering
    algorithms as described in Papenberg and Klau (2021;
    <doi:10.1037/met0000301>). The exact algorithms require that the GNU
    linear programming kit (<https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html>)
    is available and the R package 'Rglpk'
    (<https://cran.R-project.org/package=Rglpk>) is installed. A
    bicriterion anticlustering method proposed by Brusco et al.  (2020;
    <doi:10.1111/bmsp.12186>) is available through the function
    bicriterion_anticlustering(), kplus_anticlustering() implements the
    k-plus anticlustering approach proposed by Papenberg (2023;
    <doi:10.31234/osf.io/7jw6v>).  Some other functions are available to
    solve classical clustering problems. The function
    balanced_clustering() applies a cluster analysis under size
    constraints, i.e., creates equal-sized clusters. The function
    matching() can be used for (unrestricted, bipartite, or K-partite)
    matching. The function wce() can be used optimally solve the
    (weighted) cluster editing problem, also known as correlation
    clustering, clique partitioning problem or transitivity clustering.
